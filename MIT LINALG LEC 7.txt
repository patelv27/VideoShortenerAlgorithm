00:09
OK, here's linear algebra lecture seven.
00:14
I've been talking about vector spaces
00:19
and specially the null space of a matrix
00:24
and the column space of a matrix.
00:26
What's in those spaces.
00:28
Now I want to actually describe them.
00:32
How do you describe all the vectors
00:36
that are in those spaces?
00:37
How do you compute these things?
00:39
So this is the, turning the idea, the definition,
00:46
into an algorithm.
00:48
What's the algorithm for solving A x =0?
00:53
So that's the null space that I'm interested in.
00:56
So can I take a particular matrix A and describe
01:01
the natural algorithm, and I'll execute it for that matrix --
01:06
here we go.
01:08
So let me take the matrix as an example.
01:12
So we're definitely talking rectangular matrices in this
01:16
chapter.
01:17
So I'll make, I'll have four columns.
01:22
And three rows.
01:24
Two four six eight and three six eight ten.
01:32
OK.
01:36
If I just look at those columns, and rows, well,
01:42
I notice right away that column two
01:45
is a multiple of column one.
01:47
It's in the same direction as column one.
01:50
It's not independent.
01:52
I'll expect to discover that in the process.
01:56
Actually, with rows, I notice that that row plus this row
02:01
gives the third row.
02:03
So the third row is not independent.
02:07
So, all that should come out of elimination.
02:12
So now what I --
02:14
my algorithm is elimination, but extended now
02:19
to the rectangular case, where we
02:23
have to continue even if there's zeros in the pivot position,
02:30
we go on.
02:31
OK, so let me execute elimination for that matrix.
02:36
My goal is always, while I'm doing elimination --
02:42
I'm not changing the null space.
02:44
That's very important, right?
02:46
I'm solving A x equals zero by elimination,
02:50
and when I do these operations that you already know,
02:53
when I subtract a multiple of one
02:56
equation from another equation, I'm not changing the solutions.
03:02
So I'm not changing the null space.
03:04
Actually, I changing the column space, as you'll see.
03:08
So you have to pay attention.
03:10
What does elimination leave unchanged?
03:13
And the answer is the solutions to the system are not changed
03:18
because I'm doing the same thing to --
03:20
I'm doing a legitimate operations on the equations.
03:24
Of course, on the right hand side it's always zero,
03:27
and I don't plan to write zero all the time.
03:30
OK, so I'm really just working on the left side,
03:33
but the right side is, is keeping up always zeros.
03:39
OK, so what's elimination?
03:41
Well, you know where the first pivot is
03:44
and you know what to do
03:46
with it.
03:46
So can I just take the first step below here?
03:51
So that pivot row is fine.
03:55
I take two times that row away from this one and I get zero
04:00
zero.
04:01
That's signaling a difficulty.
04:03
Two, two twos away from the six leaves me with a two.
04:07
Two twos away from the eight leaves me with a four.
04:10
And now three of those away from here
04:13
is zero, again another zero, three twos away
04:17
from that eight is the two, three twos away
04:20
from that ten is a four.
04:22
OK.
04:23
That's the first stage of elimination.
04:26
I've got the first column straight.
04:31
So of course I move on to the second column.
04:35
I look in that position, I see a zero.
04:39
I look below it, hoping for a non-zero
04:43
that I can do a row exchange.
04:44
But it's zero below.
04:47
So that's telling me that that column is -- well,
04:53
what it's really going to be telling me is that that column
04:56
is a combination of the earlier columns.
04:59
It's that second column is dependent on the earlier
05:04
columns.
05:04
But I don't stop to think here.
05:09
In that column there's nothing to do.
05:11
I go on to the next.
05:12
So here's the next pivot.
05:15
So there's the first pivot and there's the second pivot,
05:18
and I just keep this elimination going downwards.
05:22
So, so the next step keeps the first row,
05:30
keeps the second row with its pivot,
05:34
so I've got my two pivots, and does elimination
05:40
to clear out the column below that pivot.
05:44
So actually you see the multiplier is one.
05:47
It subtracts row two from row three
05:50
and produces a row of zeros.
05:53
OK.
05:54
That I would call that matrix U, right?
05:59
That's our upper --
06:01
well, I can't quite say upper triangular.
06:05
Maybe upper -- I don't know -- upper something.
06:12
It's in this so-called echelon form.
06:17
The word echelon means, like, staircase form.
06:21
It's the, the non-zeros come in that staircase form.
06:25
If there was another pivot here, then the staircase
06:30
would include that.
06:32
But here's a case where we have two pivots only.
06:37
OK, so actually we've already discovered the most important
06:41
number about this matrix.
06:44
The number of pivots is two.
06:48
That number we will call the rank of the matrix.
06:51
So let me put immediately.
06:54
The rank of A --
06:58
so I'm telling you what this word
07:00
rank means in the algorithm.
07:04
It's equal to the number of pivots.
07:08
And in this case, two.
07:12
OK, for me that number two is the crucial number.
07:17
OK, now I go to -- you remember I'm always solving A x equals
07:22
zero, but now I can solve U x equals zero, right?
07:26
Same solution, same null space.
07:29
OK.
07:30
So I could stop here --
07:32
why don't I stop here and do the back substitution.
07:36
So now I have to ask you, how do I describe the solutions?
07:42
There are solutions, right, to A x equals zero.
07:45
I knew there would be.
07:47
I had three equations in four unknowns.
07:50
I certainly expected some solutions.
07:52
Now I want to see what are they.
07:55
OK, here's the critical step.
07:59
I refer to it up here as separating out
08:04
the pivot variables, the pivot columns, which are these two.
08:09
Here I have two pivot columns.
08:13
Those, obviously, they're the columns with the pivots.
08:15
So I have two pivot columns.
08:22
And I have the other columns, I'll call free.
08:27
These are free columns, OK.
08:32
Why do I use those words?
08:35
Why do I use that word free?
08:38
Because now I want to write, I want to find the solutions to U
08:43
x equals zero.
08:45
Here is the way I do it.
08:48
These free columns I can assign any number freely to those --
08:58
to the variables x2 and x4, the ones that multiply
09:03
columns two and four.
09:06
So I can assign anything I like to x2 and x4.
09:10
And then I can solve the equations for x1 and x3.
09:17
Let me say that again.
09:19
If I give -- let me, let me assign.
09:22
So, so one particular x is to assign, say, the value one
09:29
to the, to x2, and zero to x4.
09:33
Those are -- that was a free choice,
09:35
but it's a convenient choice.
09:38
OK.
09:38
Now I want to solve U x equals zero
09:41
and find numbers one and three, complete the solution.
09:47
Can I write down --
09:49
let's see.
09:49
OK.
09:50
Shall we just remember what U x equals zero represents?
09:53
What are my equations?
09:54
That first equation is x1 plus just --
10:00
I'm just saying what are these matrices meaning.
10:05
That's the first equation.
10:07
And the second equation was 2x3 + 4x4=0.
10:14
Those are my two equations.
10:16
OK.
10:17
Now the point is I can find x1 and x3 by back substitution.
10:24
So we're building on what we already know.
10:27
The new thing is that there were some free variables that I
10:31
could give any numbers to.
10:34
And I'm systematically going to make a choice like this, Now
10:38
what is x3?
10:38
1 and 0.
10:39
Let's, let's go backwards, back up.
10:42
I look at the last equation.
10:45
x3 is zero, from the last equation,
10:50
because, because x4 we've set x4 to zero,
10:55
and then we get x3 as zero.
10:58
OK.
10:58
Now we set x2 to be one, so what is x1?
11:03
Negative two, right?
11:06
So then I have negative two plus two, zero and zero,
11:10
correctly giving zero.
11:11
There is a vector in the null space.
11:14
There is a solution to A x equals zero.
11:17
In fact, what solution is that?
11:19
That simply says that minus two times the first column
11:24
plus one times the second column is the zero column.
11:28
Of course that's right.
11:29
Minus two of that column plus one of that, or minus two
11:33
of that plus one of that.
11:35
That solution is -- that, that's just what we saw immediately,
11:39
that the second column is twice as big as the first column.
11:43
OK, tell me some more vectors in the null space.
11:48
I found one.
11:51
Tell me, how to get a bunch more immediately out of that one.
11:58
Just take multiples of it.
11:59
Any multiple of --
12:01
I could multiply this by anything.
12:04
I might as well call it, I could say, C, some multiple of this.
12:08
So let me --
12:10
so X could be any multiple of this one.
12:14
OK, that, that describes now a line,
12:17
an infinitely long line in four dimensional space.
12:23
But -- which is in the null space.
12:26
Is that the whole null space?
12:29
No.
12:30
I've got two free variables here.
12:34
I made this choice, one and zero, for the free variables,
12:37
but I could have made another choice.
12:40
Let me make the other choice zero and one.
12:44
You see my system.
12:47
So let me repeat the system.
12:48
This is the algorithm that you, you just learned to do.
12:56
Do elimination.
12:59
Decide which are the pivot columns
13:01
and which are the free columns.
13:02
That tells you that, that variables one and three
13:05
are pivot variables, two and four are free variables.
13:09
Then those free variables, you assign them --
13:14
you give one of them the value one and the others the value
13:17
zero -- in this case, we had a one and a zero --
13:22
and complete the solution.
13:24
And you do -- you give the other one the value one and zero.
13:28
And now complete the solution.
13:30
So let's complete that solution.
13:32
I'm looking for a vector in the null space,
13:35
and it's absolutely going to be different from this guy,
13:38
because, because any multiple of that zero
13:42
is never going to give the one.
13:43
So I have somebody new in the null space,
13:46
and let me finish it
13:46
out.
13:47
What's x3 here?
13:50
So we're going by back substitution,
13:52
looking at this equation.
13:53
Now x4 we've changed, we're doing the other possibility,
13:59
where x2 is zero and x4 is one.
14:02
So x3 will happen to be minus two.
14:06
And now what do I get for that first equation?
14:10
x1 -- let's see.
14:12
Two x3s is minus four plus two -- do I get a two there?
14:19
Perhaps, yeah.
14:20
Two for x1, minus four, and two.
14:25
OK.
14:26
That's in the null space.
14:28
What does that say about the columns?
14:32
That says that two of this column minus two
14:37
of this column plus this column gives zero, which it does.
14:41
Two of that minus two of that and one of that
14:46
gives the zero column.
14:47
OK, now, now I've found another vector in the null space.
14:52
Now we're ready to tell me the whole null space.
14:55
What are all the solutions to Ax=0?
15:00
I've got this guy and when I have him,
15:05
what else is, goes into the null space along with that?
15:10
These are my two special solutions.
15:13
I call them special --
15:14
I just invented that name.
15:16
Special solutions.
15:18
What's special about them is the special numbers
15:21
I gave to the free variables, the values zero and one
15:27
for the free variables.
15:29
I could have given the free variables any values
15:32
and got vectors in the null space.
15:35
But this was a good way to be sure I got t- got everybody.
15:40
OK, so once I have him, I also have any multiple, right?
15:45
So I could take any multiple of that
15:48
and it's in the null space.
15:50
And now what else --
15:52
I left a little space for what?
15:55
What -- a plus sign.
15:58
I can take any combination.
16:00
Here is a line of vectors in the null space.
16:04
A bunch of solutions.
16:06
Would you rather I say in the null space or would you rather
16:09
I say, OK, I'm solving Ax=0?
16:13
Well, really I'm solving Ux=0.
16:19
Well, OK, let me put in that crucial plus sign.
16:23
I'm taking all the combinations of my two special solutions.
16:29
That's my conclusion there.
16:32
The null space contains, contains exactly
16:37
all the combinations of the special solutions.
16:42
And how many special solutions are there?
16:46
There's one for every free variable.
16:49
And how many free variables are there?
16:51
Oh, I mean, we can see all the whole picture now.
16:54
If the rank R was two, this is the,
16:59
this is the number of pivot variables, right,
17:04
because it counted the pivots.
17:08
So how many free variables?
17:11
Well, you know it's two, right?
17:14
What is it in -- for a matrix that's m rows, n columns,
17:20
n variables that means, with rank r?
17:25
How many free variables have we got left?
17:28
If r of the variables are pivot variables, we have n-r --
17:34
in this case four minus two -- free variables.
17:38
Do you see that first of all we get clean answers here?
17:53
We get r pivot variables -- so there really were r equations
17:59
here.
18:00
There looked like three equations,
18:01
but there were really only two independent equations.
18:05
And there were n-r variables that we could choose freely,
18:11
and we gave them those special zero one values,
18:16
and we got the special solutions.
18:19
OK.
18:22
For me -- we could stop at that point.
18:25
That gives you a complete algorithm
18:28
for finding all the solutions to A x equals zero.
18:34
OK.
18:38
Again, you do elimination --
18:41
going onward when a column, when there's nothing
18:46
to be done on one column, you just continue.
18:50
There's this number r, the number of pivots, is crucial,
18:55
and it leaves n-r free variables, which you
19:01
give values zero and one to.
19:03
I would like to take one more step.
19:08
I would like to clean up this matrix even more.
19:12
So now I'm going to go to -- this is in its,
19:14
this is in echelon form, upper triangular if you like.
19:20
I want to go one more step to make it as good as it can be.
19:25
OK, so now I'm going to speak about the reduced row echelon
19:31
form.
19:32
OK, so now I'm going to speak about the matrix R, which is
19:35
the reduced row echelon form.
19:44
So what does that mean?
19:46
That means I just --
19:49
I can, I can work harder on U.
19:52
So let me start, let me suppose I got as far
19:55
as U, which was good.
20:08
Notice how that row of zeros appeared.
20:11
I didn't comment on that, but I should have.
20:15
That row of zeros up here is because row three was
20:20
a combination of rows one and two,
20:23
and elimination discovered that fact.
20:27
When we get a row of zeros, that's telling us that the --
20:32
original row that was there was a combination of other rows,
20:38
and elimination knocked it out.
20:42
OK, so we got this far.
20:44
Now how can I clean that up further?
20:47
I can do, elimination upwards.
20:51
I can get zero above the pivots.
20:54
So this reduced row echelon form has zeros
20:58
above and below the pivots.
21:08
So let me do that.
21:11
So now I'll subtract one of this from the row above.
21:14
That will leave a zero and a minus two in there.
21:20
And that's good.
21:26
OK, and I can clean it up even one more step.
21:30
I can make the pivots --
21:33
the pivots I'm going to make equal to one, because I can
21:37
divide equation two by the pivot.
21:41
That won't change the solutions.
21:44
So let me do that.
21:45
And then I really --
21:46
I'm ready to stop.
21:47
One, two, zero, minus two, zero, zero, one, two.
21:53
I divided the second equation by two,
21:58
because now I have a one in the pivot and zeros below.
22:05
OK.
22:06
This is my matrix R.
22:14
I guess I'm hoping that you could now
22:17
execute the whole algorithm.
22:21
Matlab will do it immediately with the command --
22:30
reduced row echelon form of A.
22:34
So if I input that original matrix A
22:37
and then I write, then I type that command, press return,
22:43
that matrix will appear.
22:46
That's the reduced row echelon form,
22:49
and it's got all the information as clear as can be.
23:00
What, what information has it got?
23:01
Well, of course it immediately tells me
23:04
the pivot rows, pivot rows, one and two,
23:08
pivot columns, one and three.
23:11
And in fact it's got the identity matrix in there,
23:15
It's, it's got zeros above and below the pivots, right?
23:18
and the pivots are one, so it's, so it's got a --
23:22
so notice the two by two identity matrix that's sitting
23:30
in the pivot rows and pivot columns.
23:33
it's I in the pivot rows and columns.
23:46
It's got zero rows below.
23:52
Those are always indicating that original rows were,
23:56
were combinations of other rows.
23:58
So we really only had two rows there.
24:02
And now it also -- so there's the identity.
24:05
Now it's also got its free columns.
24:10
And, they're cleaned up as much as possible.
24:17
Actually, actually it's now so cleaned up that the special
24:21
solutions, I can read off -- you remember I went through
24:26
the steps of computing this --
24:30
doing back substitution?
24:32
Let me, let me, instead of that system,
24:37
let me take this improved system.
24:39
So I'm going to use these numbers, right.
24:43
In these equations, what did I do?
24:45
I divided this equation by two and, oh yeah
24:52
and I had subtracted two of this,
24:54
which knocked out this guy and made that a minus sign.
24:58
Is that what --
25:01
I've now written Rx equals zero.
25:10
Now I guess I'm hoping everybody in this room understands
25:14
the solutions to the original A x equals zero,
25:19
the midway, halfway, U x equals zero,
25:23
and the final R x equals zero are all the same.
25:27
Because going from one of those to another one
25:30
I didn't mess up.
25:33
I just multiplied equations and subtracted
25:36
from other equations, which I'm allowed to do.
25:39
OK.
25:40
But my point is that now if I do this free variables
25:47
and back substitution, it's just, the numbers are there.
25:52
When I let x -- so in this guy, I let x2 be one and x4 be zero.
26:01
I, I guess, what I seeing here?
26:04
Let me, let me sort of separate this out here.
26:07
I'm seeing in the pivot, in the pivot columns,
26:12
if I, if I put the pivot columns here, I'm seeing those.
26:16
And I'm -- in the free columns I'm seeing --
26:21
what I seeing in the free columns?
26:23
A two, zero in that first free column, the x2 column,
26:29
and a minus two, two in the fourth column,
26:33
the other free column.
26:36
And the row of zeros below, which of course have no --
26:41
that equation is zero equals zero.
26:43
That's satisfied.
26:46
Here's my point.
26:48
That when I do back substitution,
26:51
these numbers are exactly what shows up --
26:55
oh, their signs get switched.
26:58
I was going to say those numbers, two, minus two, zero,
27:01
two, can I just circle the -- this is the free part
27:06
of the matrix.
27:07
This is the identity part.
27:10
This is the free part, maybe I'll call it F.
27:14
This, of course, I call I, because it's the identity.
27:18
The free part is a, I mean, I'm just doing back substitution.
27:25
And those free numbers will show up, with a minus sign,
27:29
because they pop onto the other side of the equation --
27:32
so I see minus two, zero, and I see two, minus two.
27:39
So that wasn't magic.
27:41
It had to happen.
27:43
Let me, show you clearly why it happened.
27:48
OK, so that's --
27:50
this is what I'm interested in here.
27:53
And now let me, let me just, like, do it, do it for --
27:59
let's suppose we've, we've got to --
28:07
let's suppose we've got this system already in,
28:11
in rref form.
28:18
So my matrix R is -- what does it look like?
28:22
OK, and I'll --
28:25
let me pretend that the pivot columns come first
28:30
and then whatever's in the free columns.
28:33
And there might be some zero rows below.
28:37
There's a typical --
28:40
a pretty typical reduced row echelon form.
28:49
You see what's typical.
28:51
It's got -- this is r by r.
28:55
This is r pivot rows.
29:02
This is r pivot columns.
29:09
And here are n-r free columns.
29:16
OK.
29:17
Tell me what are the special solutions?
29:21
What are the --
29:23
what's x?
29:24
If I want to solve R x equals zero --
29:27
in fact, let me --
29:31
I'm really going to, do the whole -- since these --
29:36
this is now block matrices, I might as well do all
29:39
of the special solutions at once.
29:41
So I want to solve R x equals zero,
29:44
and I'll have some special solutions.
29:49
Let me, actually --
29:52
can I do them all at once?
29:54
I'm going to create a null space matrix, OK.
30:00
A matrix.
30:04
Its, its, its columns are the special --
30:13
the columns are the special solutions.
30:19
This is, I'm making it sound harder,
30:21
it's going to be totally easy.
30:22
N will be this null space matrix.
30:25
I want R N to be the zero matrix.
30:31
These columns of N are supposed to multipl-
30:33
to get multiplied by R and give zero columns.
30:37
So what N will do the job?
30:40
Let me put --
30:41
I'm going to put the identity in the free variable part
30:45
and then minus F will show up in the pivot variables, just
30:54
the way it did in that example.
30:55
There we had the identity and F.
30:58
Here -- in the special solution.
31:02
So these columns are -- there's the matrix of special
31:05
solutions.
31:06
And actually, there -- so there's a Matlab command
31:09
or a teaching code command, NULL --
31:14
N equal, so this is the --
31:19
produces the null basis, the null space matrix, NULL of A,
31:24
and there it is.
31:30
And how does that command actually work?
31:33
It uses Matlab to compute R, then
31:38
it picks out the pivot variables, the free variables,
31:43
puts, puts ones and zeros in for the free variables,
31:47
and copies out the pivot variables.
31:51
It, it does back substitution, but back substitution
31:54
for this system is totally simple.
31:57
What is this system?
32:00
R x equals zero.
32:03
So this is R is I F, and x is the pivot variables
32:11
and the free variables, and it's supposed to give zero.
32:18
So what does that mean?
32:20
That means that the pivot variables plus F
32:24
times the free variables give zero.
32:28
So let me put F times the free variables on the other side.
32:31
I get minus F times the free variables.
32:37
There's my, equation, as simple as it can be.
32:43
That's what back substitution comes
32:45
to when I've reduced and reduced and reduced this system
32:49
to the, to the best form, OK.
32:52
And, then if the free variables, I
32:56
make this special choice of the identity,
33:00
then the pivot variables are
33:02
minus F. OK, can I do, another example?
33:08
Could you do another example?
33:10
Can I -- let me just take another matrix
33:12
and, and let's go through this algorithm once more, OK.
33:17
Here we go.
33:19
Here's a blackboard for another matrix, OK.
33:25
So I'll call the matrix A again, but let me make it --
33:31
yeah, how big shall we make it this time?
33:36
Why don't I do this?
33:38
Just for the heck of it.
33:39
Let me take the transpose of this A and see what happens to
33:44
that.
33:45
Two four six eight and three six eight ten.
34:00
Before we do the calculations, tell me what's coming?
34:06
How many pivot variables do you expect here?
34:12
How many columns are going to have pivots?
34:16
How many -- we have three columns in that matrix,
34:22
but are we going to, are we going to have three pivots?
34:25
No, because this third columns is the sum of the first two
34:31
columns.
34:32
I'm totally expecting, totally expecting that these will be
34:38
pivot columns --
34:41
because they're independent, but that this third guy,
34:45
the third column, which is dependent on the first two,
34:49
is going to be a free column.
34:52
Elimination better discover that.
34:54
And elimination will also straighten out
34:58
the rows, dependent rows and some independent rows.
35:05
What's the, what's the row reduced echelon form for this?
35:09
Let's just do it, OK.
35:11
So, so that's the first pivot.
35:16
Two times that away from that gives me a row of zeros.
35:20
Two times that away from that gives me a zero two two.
35:24
And two times that away from that gives me a zero four four.
35:32
OK, first column is straight.
35:35
First variable is a pivot variable.
35:37
No problem.
35:39
On to the second column.
35:40
I look at the second pivot, it's a zero.
35:43
I look below it.
35:45
There's a two.
35:46
OK, I do a row exchange.
35:50
So this zero is now there.
35:53
I now have a perfectly good pivot, and I use it.
35:58
OK, and I subtract two of that row away from this row.
36:03
All right if I do it like that?
36:05
I've got to the form U now.
36:08
This was my A.
36:10
Now there's my U. I can see now --
36:17
I have to stop, right?
36:18
I would go on to the third column.
36:20
I should have tried.
36:22
I quit, but without trying.
36:24
I shouldn't have done that.
36:25
On to the third column, look at the pivot position.
36:28
It's got a zero in it.
36:30
Look below, all zeros.
36:32
Now I'm entitled to stop, OK.
36:35
So the rank is two again.
36:45
What about the null space?
36:48
How many special solutions are there this time?
36:52
How many special solutions for this matrix?
36:56
I've got -- and which are the free variables and which are
36:59
the pivot variables and so on?
37:01
Pivot columns, I've got two pivot columns,
37:04
and that's no accident.
37:06
The number of pivot columns for a matrix A, that's
37:11
a great fact, that the number of pivot columns for A
37:16
and A transpose are the same.
37:19
And then I have a free column.
37:21
There's a free column.
37:24
One free column, because the count is three minus two.
37:30
Three minus two gives me one free column.
37:37
OK, so now let me solve, what's in the null space.
37:47
OK, so how do I --
37:49
let's see.
37:50
These vectors have length three.
37:52
They only have three components.
37:54
I'm making too much space for the, to write x.
37:58
x has just got three components, and what are they?
38:03
I'm looking for the null space.
38:09
OK, so how do I start?
38:12
I give the free variable some convenient value.
38:17
And what's that?
38:20
I set it to one.
38:23
I set the free variable to one.
38:24
If I set the free variable to zero and solve
38:28
for the pivot variables, I'll get all zeros: no progress.
38:33
But by setting the free variable to one --
38:36
you see w- my two equations now are --
38:39
my equations are x1+ 2x2+ 3 x3 is zero,
38:45
that's my first equation.
38:47
And my second equation is now 2x2+2x3 equals zero.
38:51
And, OK.
38:56
So if x3 is one, then x2 is minus one.
39:02
And if x3 is one and x2 is minus one, then maybe x1
39:07
is minus one.
39:12
And actually I go back to check now.
39:14
I don't, like --
39:17
I did a quick calculation mentally.
39:19
Can I mentally do a quick check?
39:21
That matrix, that solution x says
39:24
that minus this column minus this column plus this one
39:28
is the zero column.
39:31
And it is.
39:32
Minus that minus that plus that is zero.
39:35
So that's in the null space.
39:37
And now you can tell me what else is in the null space.
39:40
What's, what's the whole null space now?
39:44
I multiply by C, right.
39:46
The whole null space is a line.
39:51
So that's the description.
39:52
You know, if I ask you on a homework or a quiz or the final
39:57
what -- give me, describe, tell me the null space,
40:01
find the null space of this matrix,
40:04
you can take those steps.
40:07
And that's the answer I'm looking for.
40:10
And I'm looking for that C too, because that's telling me
40:15
that you're remembering that it's a whole space and not
40:18
just one vector.
40:20
Later I will ask you for a basis for the null space.
40:23
Then I just want this vector.
40:26
But if I ask for the whole null space,
40:28
then there's the whole line through that vector.
40:31
OK, now one more natural thing to do with this example, right,
40:36
is keep going to the reduced matrix, R.
40:43
So can I push onwards to R?
40:46
That should be quick, but let's just practice.
40:49
Let me keep going to R. OK, so what do I do here?
40:54
I subtract --
40:55
I clear out above the pivot, so I
40:57
subtract that from that, that's one zero one is left, right?
41:02
When I subtracted this row from this
41:04
it produced a zero above this pivot.
41:07
And now I want that pivot to be a one.
41:12
So for the R matrix, I'll divide this equation by two,
41:18
and of course these zero, zeros are great, they don't change.
41:23
There's R.
41:24
That's R.
41:27
You see what R is?
41:28
You see the identity matrix sitting up here?
41:32
You see the free part F, the F part here?
41:36
And you see the zeros below.
41:38
This is I F zero zero.
41:42
And what's the x?
41:45
The x has the identity --
41:48
well, it's only a single number one,
41:51
but it's the identity matrix in the free, in the free part.
41:56
And what does it have in the pivot variables?
42:00
What did back substitution give?
42:03
It gave minus these guys.
42:06
You see that what this is is any multiple of --
42:11
this is the identity there, and this is minus F here.
42:19
This is our null space matrix N for this.
42:24
Our, our null space matrix is the guy whose columns
42:28
are the special solutions.
42:30
So their free variables have the special values
42:33
one and, pivot variables have minus F.
42:39
So do you see, though, how the minus F just
42:42
automatically shows up in the special solutions.
42:49
That's it really.
42:50
I don't think there's anything more I
42:51
can say about A x equals zero.
42:55
There's more I can say about A x equal b,
42:59
but that'll be on Friday.
43:03
OK, so that's, that's the null space.
43:05
Thanks.
